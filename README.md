# Spotify to File
A dead simple Python script to output Spotify's current song to a text file/stdout.

## Usage
To run the script:

    python spotify-to-file.py

On Linux you can dettach the program so it runs on the background:

    nohup python spotify-to-file.py &

## Dependencies
The only dependency is SwSpotify:

    pip install SwSpotify
